# 360 Gym Management API

A comprehensive RESTful API for gym management system built with PHP, featuring secure authentication, announcement management, staff administration, operating hours control, and special closure handling.

## üöÄ Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Announcement Management**: CRUD operations for gym announcements with different types and priorities
- **Staff Management**: Complete staff member lifecycle management with user accounts
- **Operating Hours**: Dynamic gym hours management with current status checking
- **Closure Management**: Special closures, holidays, and emergency closure handling
- **Security**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling
- **API Standards**: RESTful design with proper HTTP status codes and consistent response format

## üìã Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- Apache/Nginx web server
- mod_rewrite enabled (for Apache)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone/Download the API files** to your web server directory
2. **Configure your web server** to point to the `api` directory
3. **Set up database configuration** in `config/config.php`
4. **Run database migrations** by accessing `/api/v1/migrate`
5. **Configure environment variables** (optional but recommended for production)

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the API root directory (optional):

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=360gym_db
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASS=your_password
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
```

### Database Setup

The API includes an automatic migration system. Access the migration endpoint to set up the database:

```
GET /api/v1/migrate
```

This will create all necessary tables and insert initial data including:
- Default admin user (username: `admin`, password: `admin123!`)
- Default gym hours
- Sample announcement

## üîê Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

### User Roles

- **Member**: Basic access (currently limited functionality)
- **Staff**: Can manage announcements, view staff information, manage hours and closures
- **Admin**: Full access to all features including user management
